## üìù Project Description
This project's aim is the development of a simple game loosely inspired by the "**Pogo-A-Gogo**" minigame from Crash Bash, where STM32F3DISCOVERY boards are used as controllers.

In further detail, the readings of angular velocity coming from the "**L3GD20**" gyroscope (which is mounted on the board and communicates with the microcontroller via the **SPI protocol**) will be transmitted to the game process using a "**HC-05**" Bluetooth module for each board; then, said readings will be used to control the position on the screen of the player associated with the singular board.

## üí° Regarding the Python requirements
During the project's development, the dependencies listed in the "**requirements.txt**" file were installed within a **_virtual environment_**: this is the recommended approach, as it helps prevent potential conflicts with globally installed Python packages.
