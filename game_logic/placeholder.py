# This folder will contain all of the assets and logic related to the "LED-A-Gogo" game.

# The intent is to program a simple game with "pygame", but the current priority is the acquisition of information
# from the gyroscope and the communication (via USB) between the computer and the Discovery Board.

# "pyserial" might be necessary to ensure the Python program can read serial data trasmitted by the board.
